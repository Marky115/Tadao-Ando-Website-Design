                In his deisgn process, Ando wanted to reflect the mood of calmness 
                when he felt walking through his inspiring sties at naoshima museum in Japan. 
                The structure of the building is combine with many natural elements to give a sense 
                of stillness and calmness such as incoporating the cherry blossom trees with the water. 
                He also wanted the building to be very clear and transparent. Natural lighting is 
                greatly emphasize in the deisgn. He uses alot of glass surrounding the entire half of 
                the building which lets alot of natural light in as well as he uses the color white. 
                This help create an tranquality mood around the design of the building.
